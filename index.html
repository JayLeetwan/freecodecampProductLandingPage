            <p>The Chevrolet Monte Carlo is a two-door coupe that was manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet from 1970 to 2007 model years (non-continuously), encompassing six generations. Chevrolet positioned the Monte Carlo as a personal luxury car, with the last generation classified as a full-sized coupé. </p>

            <p>The first four generations of the Monte Carlo (1970–1972, 1973–1977, 1978–1980, and 1981–1988) were of a rear-wheel-drive, V8-powered (a V6 engine from 1978) coupe design, using body-on-frame construction. The later rear-wheel-drive generations did not incorporate the trend of uni-body construction that became more prevalent in the early 1980s as automakers downsized their vehicle lines to satisfy increasing demand for fuel-economy after the 1973 oil crisis and the early 1980s recession. </p>

            <p>After the discontinuation of the rear-drive Monte Carlo after 1988, the nameplate was revived in 1994 for the fifth-generation, a front-drive, V6-powered coupe based on the Chevrolet Lumina sedan. The sixth and final-generation Monte Carlo from 1999 was built alongside the Chevrolet Impala, which succeeded the Lumina as Chevrolet's mid-sized sedan. The Monte Carlo SS was revived from 1999 to 2007, that was initially powered by 3.8 L V6 (supercharged in 2004 and 2005) and by a 5.3 L V8 for 2006 and 2007. </p>

            <p>The car was named for the city Monte Carlo in the Principality of Monaco, specifically the ward of Monte Carlo/Spélugues. </p>

            <h3>First generation (1970–1972)</h3>

            <h4>Development</h4>

            <p>For the 1968 model year, GM instituted a split-wheelbase policy for its A-platform intermediate-sized cars. Two-door models would have a 112 in (2,845 mm) wheelbase, 116 in (2,946 mm) for sedans, and 121 in (3,073 mm) for station wagons. In 1969, GM introduced the Pontiac Grand Prix, a two-door that used A-platform layout that was stretched ahead of the firewall to make it 210.2-inch (5,339 mm) long. This gave the design an unusually long hood design helping the new Grand Prix to outsell its larger B-body predecessor, despite higher prices. The new layout was first known as the A-body Special, but would evolve into its own class known as the G-platform. </p>

            <p>The Monte Carlo started as Chevrolet's version of Pontiac Grand Prix, as conceived by Elliot M. (Pete) Estes, general manager of Chevrolet, and Chevrolet's chief stylist, David Holls. They modeled the styling on the contemporary Cadillac Eldorado, although much of the body and structure were shared with the Chevrolet Chevelle (firewall, windshield, decklid, and rear window were the same). New exterior "coke bottle styling" featured concealed windshield wipers. A light monitoring system was optional.</p>

            <p>A mid-1990s article in the magazine Chevrolet High Performance stated that the first generation Monte Carlo was known to Chevrolet management under the working name Concours. Usual practice at the time was that all Chevrolet model development names started with a "C". At one point, the proposal called for a formal coupe, sedan, and convertible. It has been noted that the sedan resembled a full-size Oldsmobile 98 prior to the use of the GM G platform with at least one photo showing the pull-up door handles that would be introduced on the 1970½ Camaro and 1971 Vega and full-sized Chevys, but not appear on Monte Carlos until the second-generation model debuted in 1973. When the car debuted for the 1970 model year, the only body style available was the two-door hardtop. </p>

            <p>Though the Monte Carlo was developed at Chevrolet under the leadership of Pete Estes, it was formally introduced in September 1969 by John Z. DeLorean, who succeeded Estes as Chevrolet's general manager earlier in the year after previously heading the Pontiac division, where he led the development of the Grand Prix. </p>

            <h4>1970</h4>

            <p>The styling of the 1970 model-year Monte Carlo is distinguished by its chromed rectangular grille having a fine grid pattern of 720 small squares with two horizontal dividers, and centered in it, a chrome and red crest emblem adorned by a Corinthian helmet (commonly referred to as the “knight’s crest”[4]), a thin hood spear with no vertical hood ornament, round headlamps with rounded chrome bezels (which appeared on a prototype 1970 Chevelle front end proposal which was rejected for the 4 headlight design), circular parking lamps inset into the front bumper directly below the headlamps, and tail lights with chrome trim around the perimeter of the lens, only. </p>
